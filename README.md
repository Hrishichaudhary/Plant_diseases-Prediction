# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Prediction

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images, empowering farmers and agriculturists with early diagnosis. By processing images with deep learning models built using TensorFlow and Keras, the application classifies leaves as healthy or diseased, identifying specific plant diseases with high accuracy.

# Installation

  * Prerequisites

    * Python: Version 3.8 or higher

    * Git: For cloning the repository

    * Optional: GPU for faster model training (CUDA-enabled for TensorFlow)


# Setup

* Clone the Repository:

  * git clone https://github.com/Hrishichaudhary/Plant_diseases-Prediction.git
  * cd plant_disease_prediction

# Install Dependencies:

 * pip install -r requirements.txt

   * This installs required packages like tensorflow, keras, opencv-python, matplotlib, 
     and seaborn.

# Usage

 ## Training the Model

   * Train the CNN model using your dataset:

     * python src/train_model.py --data_dir data/ --epochs 50

       * --data_dir: Path to the dataset folder.
       * --epochs: Number of training epochs (default: 50).

# Running Predictions

## Classify a new plant leaf image:

   * python src/predict.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
     * --image_path: Path to the input image.

# Jupyter Notebooks

# Results

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying plant diseases. Below are example predictions:

| Image  | Prediction         | Confidence   |
|--------|--------------------|--------------|
| Leaf 1 | **Tomato Blight**  | **92.3%**    |
|Leaf 2  | **Healthy**        | **98.6%**    |
